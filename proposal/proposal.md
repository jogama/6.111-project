should be 3-5 pages long, single spaced, with figures / diagrams

  - draft block diagram
    specify for each module
    * inputs/outputs 
	* information flowing between (ins/outs
    * compexity / level of performance
      ~ number+type of arithmetic operations
      ~ size of if internal memories
      ~ required throughput
  - external components planning to borrow, buy, or build
      ¿ cost?
      ¿ complexity ?
      ~ how will it interface with the FPGA
      
	
  - pray
